The worlds of fashion and art have been abuzz with new things lately. For this week’s Friday Fête, we’ve put together a list of some of the hottest events and launches from the past week.

This time last week, on February 16, **Mulberry** launched its Spring/Summer 2018 collection in London, Beyond Heritage. The series of events celebrating the new line was held at the 18th-century **Spencer House**. The new collection (inspired by English garden parties, the Edwardian era, and traditional tea in fine-bone china) features feminine silhouettes, a cheery range of colors, and turn-of-the-century touches like frills and organza.

Over the weekend in New York, **Barney Savage Gallery** director **Julian Lorber** hosted the gallery’s inaugural exhibition entitled “Color We’ll.” The show, curated by **Alex Allenchey**, is a collection of paintings by six artists (**Andrea Bergart**, **Lucy Mink** **Covello**, **Corydon Cowansage**, **Theresa Daddezio**, **Emily Kiacz**, and **Lauren Silva**). While the artists’ works all begin in the field of abstraction, each branches out to take the viewer on a unique and personal experience unlike the next. “Color We’ll” is on display through March 18.

On Monday evening we headed to the **Rose Bar** in **Gramercy Park Hotel** for one of the renowned Rose Bar Sessions. The special invite-only performances began in 2009 as a way of bringing world-class musicians into an intimate setting. For this week’s show, artist **BØRNS** returned to perform a second set for the sessions. Other recent performances in this sweet spot include **Liza Minelli**, **Rufus Wainwright**, and **Axl Rose**.

Wednesday night in London, **Takashi Murakami** and **Virgil Abloh**’s collaborative exhibition “Future History” made its debut at **Gagosian Gallery**. Kindred spirit Murakami (who is influenced by things like traditional Japanese painting, Hollywood, and hip-hop) and Abloh (architect, designer, and founder of **Off-White)** used their diverse cultural backgrounds to create a series of freewheeling and punkish works. The collaboration includes a series of sculptures and paintings in which the duo used art to explore the signs of the times in which we live today. “Future History” is open to the public through April 7.

And on Thursday night, back in New York at the **Catinca Tabacaru Gallery**, we stopped by artist **Yapci Ramos**’s chilling solo exhibition “Red Hot.” The project started as a spontaneous act wherein Ramos wrote one word on her bathroom wall each month for two years in large red, wet letters. Now an 18-screen video installation, viewers will watch the nude artist spread red pigment onto her canvas, only to wipe it away moments later.

And this weekend, we plan on hopping on a MetroNorth train and stopping by **Heather Gaudio Fine Arts** in New Canaan, CT to see **Jeremy Holmes**’ solo exhibition, “New Sculpture.” The beautiful show, on view through March 17, is a display of freestanding and wall-mounted sculptures, and a large site-specific installation. The sculptures are elegant, abstract wooden artworks created using traditional woodworking techniques.

We also plan on stopping by **Dover Street Market New York** (DSMNY) to see some new creations while shopping. The store, home to a multitude of designers and creators from different fields, shines with new collections by **Comme des Garçons** (like the Three Dimensional Graffiti collection), **Simone Rocha**, and new brands for DSMNY like **Itchy Scratchy Patchy** and **Maor**.
