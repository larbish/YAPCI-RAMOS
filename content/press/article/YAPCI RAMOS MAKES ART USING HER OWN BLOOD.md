article-title: YAPCI RAMOS MAKES ART USING HER OWN BLOOD

A woman gets her period an average of 450 times over the course of her lifetime, but yet, the process remains largely invisible. When we get our periods, we don’t flaunt them. We stick a piece of cotton in our bodies to absorb the blood, and complain privately, in pajamas, about the pain we feel in our bodies.

When I get my period, I hide the signs of it from my husband and my daughter, who otherwise know my body intimately. I wrap my tampons in toilet paper, and bury them in the bottom of the trash. I bleach any stained clothing. I keep my legs closed because periods emit a specific smell, and I don’t want that smell to escape into the air around me.

Not so for the Spanish artist Yapci Ramos, who for two years, collected her menstrual blood, and then filmed herself using it to write words on the white-tiled walls of her bathroom. The resulting work, entitled “Red-Hot,” is an 18-channel video installation currently on view at Catinca Tabacaru Gallery in New York. The exhibition closes on March 11.

“I wanted to reconnect to my blood,” Ramos told me over Skype. “It was intuitive. It was visceral. I did it without thinking about any words. It was more about documenting myself in a moment in my life.”

The first thing that struck me about the videos is how little blood there is. Ramos, whose back is to the camera, cups the blood in her hands, and begins to form letters. She must trace over her lines multiple times. Simple words emerge. “Go.” “Why.” “Stop.” “Be.” “True.” What emerges, more than any feelings of disgust or primitiveness, is a feeling of desperation. Does Ramos have enough blood to say what she wants?

“I can make one word per period,” she says. “That is the limit of the material.”

The video looks as though it is made in the moment when Ramos sits down on the toilet, and realizes, in a gesture familiar to so many women, that her period has arrived by the presence of blood on toilet paper. In fact, Ramos collected her blood in a cup she wore throughout the day. When she had enough, she went to the bathroom, and filmed herself writing.

She did not plan what she would write beforehand. Instead, she relied on instinct. "Some months, I felt like asking myself a lot of questions," she told me. "Sometimes, I felt anxious. Things came up depending on how I felt in the moment."

When the word was finished, Ramos cleaned it off the wall — an act that is also captured by the camera. “Every month, when you get your period, your body is cleaning itself,” she said. The film reflects this internal (and natural) function.

Ramos' apartment would often smell of menstruation for days after the filming was done, and the word was gone. “It keeps around some energy,” Ramos said of the smell. “But the energy was more empowering. I started to understand my relationship with my body differently.”

Ramos, at the time, was living alone. If our apartment smelled like my period for the days when I have it, I wonder if my husband would move out. In a way, I want to challenge his tolerance of it. I want him to know that those days are different for me than the rest of the days of the month. I’m less tolerant myself. I’m tired. I’m cranky. I get angry easily. The smell of a period would notify him. It would take the burden of apologizing away from me for once in my life.

The question that remains is this — is “Red-Hot” a worthy work of art, in the sense that you should go see it? I think yes. I felt empowered by it. Not because I am ashamed of my period, but because I am angry that I have to hide it. When I’m hormonal, and pissed off, I want to film myself writing an expletive on the walls of my shower with my own blood without fear of getting put in a mental institution, or getting removed from Facebook for posting inappropriate content.

Empowering women is the lifelong work of gallerist Catinca Tabacaru, who began her career as a litigation attorney before founding Women’s Voices Now, a non-profit organization that supports female filmmakers in Muslim-dominant countries. Ramos is one many young, female artists Tabacaru is boosting with her latest platform — the gallery. Presumably all of them won’t be making work with their period blood — but even if they were, f\*\*k it, at least it's a renewable resource.
