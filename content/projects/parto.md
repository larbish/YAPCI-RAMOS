    title: Sexual desire, maternal desire, desire for freedom
    ---
      :::::project-section-one-gapped-pragraph
      In Parto, I create an allegory that explores the
      process of questioning, shedding, and liberating
      oneself from the societal ideologies surrounding
      motherhood to pave the way for alternative
      perspectives. This concept is materialized through
      the construction of a symbolic and immersive
      corridor that gradually narrows, leading to
      “the other side.” It reflects three stages marked
      by sexual desire, the yearning for motherhood, and
      the pursuit of freedom, covering the age range of 35
      to 46.

      This installation delves into topics that are increasingly prominent in social and feminist discourse, resonating with many women of my generation. These issues are recontextualized within a historical moment undergoing a paradigm shift regarding perceptions of motherhood and fertility. The work acknowledges the widespread decline in the willingness to commit, influenced by growing individualism, coupled with the challenges posed by neoliberalism and the absence of supportive policies for work-life balance.
