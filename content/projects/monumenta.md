      content: In 'Monumenta. Nine Guanche Incarnations', I aim to give visibility to the forgotten Guanche woman and question the ways in which the pre-colonial past is represented from a contemporary perspective. Through the observation of various monuments, I undertake a historical analysis to resolve the enigmas underlying the underrepresentation of these subaltern identities.

      content: Guanche women held active roles in the communities of pre-Hispanic Tenerife.                     With colonialism, the                     aboriginal society came to be regulated by patriarchal premises that perpetuated certain narratives                     while obscuring others, leading to a collective amnesia of the otherness. Through an artistic,                     historical, and social investigation, I developed nine identities inspired by the landscapes of each of the ancient demarcations.
