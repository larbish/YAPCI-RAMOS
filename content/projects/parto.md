title: Sexual desire, maternal desire, desire for freedom

:::project-section-one-gapped-pragraph
In Parto, I create an allegory that explores the
process of questioning, shedding, and liberating
oneself from the societal ideologies surrounding
motherhood to pave the way for alternative
perspectives. This concept is materialized through
the construction of a symbolic and immersive
corridor that gradually narrows, leading to
“the other side.” It reflects three stages marked
by sexual desire, the yearning for motherhood, and
the pursuit of freedom, covering the age range of 35
to 46.
