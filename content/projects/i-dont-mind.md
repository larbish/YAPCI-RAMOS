    content: ‘I don’t mind’ is an artwork to visit stripped down form prejudices–those sounds are talking to us about sex, self-pleasure. And, in that context, our relationship with sexuality is settled. After having put in crisis all the inherited constructs and apprehended symbologies, it is worth asking oneself about the immanence of the very own act of masturbating. In the capacity of one’s own production of pleasure lies the question of self-sufficiency and in it, the possibility, but also the condition, of solitude.

    content: The artistic processes involve a journey of germination, imagination, and birth to inaugurate a horizon, much like the body in the process of gestating ideas, questions, or life gives birth to an unexplored path. In this play of parallels and possibilities around the desire for creation or procreation, the piece ‘Parto’ is constructed.
