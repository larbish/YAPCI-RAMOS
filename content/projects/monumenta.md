      ---
      content: In 'Monumenta. Nine Guanche Incarnations', I aim to give visibility to the forgotten Guanche woman and question the ways in which the pre-colonial past is represented from a contemporary perspective. Through the observation of various monuments, I undertake a historical analysis to resolve the enigmas underlying the underrepresentation of these subaltern identities.

      content: Guanche women held active roles in the communities of pre-Hispanic Tenerife.                     With colonialism, the                     aboriginal society came to be regulated by patriarchal premises that perpetuated certain narratives                     while obscuring others, leading to a collective amnesia of the otherness. Through an artistic,                     historical, and social investigation, I developed nine identities inspired by the landscapes of each of the ancient demarcations.

    content: ‘Monumenta’ could be you and me. Looking back, following our own footsteps we’ve made to reach that essence, that origin, where everything was more genuine. Through embodying them, they get a voice and a place to express themselves, iniciating a path through their stories, territories and feelings. This is how I reencounter these forgotten subjects and I inhabit and honor them.

    content: Public space must be re-appropriated. Each person should be free to reconstruct their own past and formulate alternative narratives. In doing so, ‘Monumenta’ offers a renewed gaze through a cartography of women who represent values that escape from normativity, while claiming for a greater presence of women and subaltern identities in public space.
