    content: We cry because of our suffering, but also as an allegory for a time of global uncertainty. That is how permission to feel, be saddened and reconsider the expression of feelings is allowed. Faces speak about identity, loneliness, individualism, and isolation. An act of liberation is captured and that experience is recreated for the viewer. As a form of catharsis, this project has the potential to become an act of healing and euphoria. Lloro invites the audience to stop and reconnect with their humanity in order to carry on.

      content: Few emotions elicit as much violence and empathy as crying. Lloro, an altar that elevates our fragility to the antipodes of the social taboo that still weighs on the different manifestations of the intimate.

    content: In Parto, I create an allegory that explores the process of questioning,  shedding, and liberating oneself from the societal ideologies surrounding motherhood to pave the way                     for alternative perspectives. This concept is materialized through the construction of a symbolic                     and immersive corridor that gradually narrows, leading to “the other side.” It reflects three stages                     marked by sexual desire, the yearning for motherhood, and the pursuit of freedom, covering the age                     range of 35 to 46. This installation delves into topics that are increasingly prominent in social                     and feminist discourse, resonating with many women of my generation. These issues are                     recontextualized within a historical moment undergoing a paradigm shift regarding perceptions of                     motherhood and fertility. The work acknowledges the widespread decline in the willingness to commit,                     influenced by growing individualism, coupled with the challenges posed by neoliberalism and the                     absence of supportive policies for work-life balance.
